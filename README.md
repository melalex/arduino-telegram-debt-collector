# arduino-telegram-debt-collector

## Description

A lightweight Telegram bot running on Arduino that helps you track personal debts in a private chat.
The bot uses an inline keyboard interface for smooth interaction and stores who owes what, based on each user’s chat_id.

* Arduino board with Telegram Bot support (e.g., ESP32/ESP8266).
* Wi-Fi connection.
* Bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
